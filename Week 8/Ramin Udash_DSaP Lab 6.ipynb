    "\n",
    "1. Press the `install requirements` button above to install the required packages.  See the `requirements.txt` for list of packages to be installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Make sure that you are following the conventions.  For examples, `import pandas as pd`, which imports pandas packages and sets the abbreviation for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Do not import the packages without the short names.  Doing so might lead to a namespace conflict, or unintended uses of functions coming from two libraries as a part of different implementations.\n",

    "4. We are assigning `None` to variables and use `pass` in the body of the functions, where we expect a solution from you.  Please replace these values and statements with your solution."
