    "1. Install the libraries listed below using your package manager.  An example of installing the library `numpy` is to issue a the following command on a terminal (in Ubuntu) `python3 -m pip install numpy`.\n",

    "2. Make sure that you are following the conventions.  For examples, `import numpy as np`, which imports `numpy` packages and sets the abbreviation for it.\n",

    "\n",
    "In Matplotlib, we can provide the data for `x` axis and `y` axis as, for example, lists, and in this order, and it plots the data points on a two dimensional picture, setting up automaticall the limits along the axes and labels.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Read the data from `IBM.csv` into a pandas `DataFrame`.\n",
    "2. Reset the index to the timestamps provided by the `\"Date\"` column in the `df`\n",
    "3. Plot the data provided by `\"Open\"` column using `DataFrame` method `plot()` (against the date it corresponds to)\n",
    "4. Take the date column from the original `DataFrame` named `df` and using Python's builtin `list` function to convert it to a list of strings.  Let us call it `x`.\n",
    "5. Do the same step as above for the column `\"Open\"`.  Let us give it the name `y`.\n",
    "6. Plot `x` and `y` using Matplotlib.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remarks:**\n",
    "1. Notice that the plotting these `x` and `y` using `Matplotlib` is much slower than the pandas method `plot`.  This should also explain a point from an earlier homework that the builtin `list` data type is much slower when its size is slower.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. You might also want to provide the columns directly to `Matplotlib` to notice that this is also inefficient, i.e., it takes more time."

    "Consider the data from the file `IBM.csv`. Your task is to create a subplots following the steps below:\n",

    "1. Use pandas method `plot()` to create subplots for the columns `\"Open\"` and `\"Close\"`.\n",
    "2. Create a vertically stacked histogram plot for the columns `\"Open\"` and `\"Close\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remarks:**\n",
    "1. Since pandas provides plotting of the `DataFrame`, but it is limited to what `Matplotlib` offers.  Since pandas used `Matplotlib`, therefore, any post processing or stacking or over-drawing of the plots provided by `Matplotlib` could be used.\n",
    "2. You are encouraged to create get hold of the subplots and plot using `pandas`' method `plot()` to actually plot the data, or mixing with the normal plotting of the data with the `pandas` method `plot()`.  It is very normal we might need to create subplots with `pandas`' `DataFrame` and other subplots with, let us say, `numpy` arrays."
